                        <p>Configure AI in <strong>Settings → AI Settings → AI Summary Function Enable</strong>. After turning on the switch, configure the corresponding settings in model configuration. Currently supports the following four types:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>OpenAI Compatible Format:</strong> Supports OpenAI and LLMs that support OpenAI format. Fill in the corresponding key, api host, and model name. If you use a proxy (such as gemini to OpenAI), also choose this type.<br>
                            If you don't have an account, visit the OpenAI official website <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">https://openai.com/</a> to register. After successful registration, log in to OpenAI, go to the API keys management page, and click "Create new secret key" to create a new API Key.<br>
                            In addition, similar models like DeepSeek and kimi that support OpenAI format can be configured in this option.</li>

                            <li><strong>DeepSeek:</strong> Log in to the DeepSeek open platform and create a key. If you don't have an account, register one on the official website: <a href="https://platform.deepseek.com/" target="_blank">https://platform.deepseek.com/</a></li>

                            <li><strong>Google Gemini:</strong> Recommended choice. For the basic model for generating summaries, choose gemini-1.5-flash-8b or above to meet the requirements, then set advanced LLM in custom settings for the model in chat mode.<br>
                            If you don't have an account, go directly to Google's official website to register. Address: <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey" target="_blank">https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey</a> After registration, create an API key.</li>

                            <li><strong>SiliconFlow:</strong> Directly fill in the api key. If the dropdown options don't have the model you're using, manually input the model name. If you don't have an account, register directly. Registration address: <a href="https://account.siliconflow.cn/" target="_blank">https://account.siliconflow.cn/</a></li>
